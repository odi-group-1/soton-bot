You should create a business account. That business needs to have a page on Facebook.

1. Go to [Facebook Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/) and Log in using your account.
2. Create a new business or if you already have a business page, it will log into it.
3. The owner of this business/you should create a Facebook Page from their personal account (Find more [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/104002523024878/)). The page will _be_ the Bot's Facebook Entity. We called our page _Soton Bot_.
